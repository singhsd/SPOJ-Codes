# SPOJ-Codes
This repository contains the codes of my submissions on [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com). All the codes were downloaded conveniently by using my own SPOJ Crawler, implemented in Python. It is an awesome script to download all submissions hassle free. Check it out [here](https://github.com/singhsd/SPOJ-Crawler).
